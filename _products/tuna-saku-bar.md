description: >
   It is commonly used as maguro in sushi bars.
   It is boneless, skinless, frozen vacuum packed yellowfin tuna that has been cold smoked (processed with filtered wood smoke) to keep its red color.
   Yellowfin has a mild flavor and meaty consistency, somewhat similar to swordfish.
   It is firm and moist, with a bright red color that turns brown, gray or tan when cooked.
   Yellowfin is best served raw as sashimi or seared and served rare.
