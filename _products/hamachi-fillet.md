description: >
   Hamachi is the most consistent and reliable fish to use all year around.
   Hamachi is technically a farmed yellowtail; with the same fantastic flavor and rich, luxurious texture due to a nice high fat content.
   Â the fish has a lovely, firm texture; seared, it becomes buttery and practically melts in your mouth.
