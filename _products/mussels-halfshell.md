description: >
   Mussels Halfshell are easily recognized by their vibrant green and gold shell coloring.
   Their plump meat is tender and creamy white when the mussel is male and apricot to orange when the mussel is female.
   Flavor is not differentiated by color and the flavor of both is superb.
   It is commonly baked and garnished with butter and garlic.
