   This is the prime part of a fillet from a large round fish. It is the part of the fillet which is above the spine, sometimes called the top back loin. For steaks In a pan, heat the olive oil until it starts to smoke, then put in 4 pieces of bacalao - it is best to fry them in batches so that the oil maintains the ideal temperature. Turn the loins over within 3 to 5 minutes in order to finish the cooking. They should be fried through, nicely browned but still juicy inside. Proceed in the same manner for the second batch.
