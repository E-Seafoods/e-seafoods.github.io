    This is the prime part of a fillet from a large round fish.
   It is the part of the fillet which is above the spine, sometimes called the top back loin.
   For steaks  In a pan, heat the olive oil until it starts to smoke, then put in 4 pieces of bacalao -  it is best to fry them in batches so that the oil maintains the ideal temperature.
   Turn the loins over within 3 to 5 minutes in order to finish the cooking.
   They should be fried through, nicely browned but still juicy inside.
   Proceed in the same manner for the second batch.
